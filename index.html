			 <h3> Fitness <i class="fas fa-dumbbell"></i> </h3> 
		      <p> Gym enthusiast, I've trained and motivated many of friends. Having been a regular gym goer for over 5 years, I made my own 6 weeks glute building workout guide based on science and experience. This guide is dedicated to women, who like me, wish to be tonned with curves. It also includes tips on how to stay motivated, and dietary recommendations.

		 	<h3> Luxury  <i class="fas fa-cocktail"></i> </h3>
		    <p> I've always had an eye for detail. I've been captivated by beautiful things. To me, wearing luxury brands is more than just a status symbol because they create dream and desire. Luxury aren't things that are necessarily useful, but things that make us happy. We will always need luxury because we need beauty. We need the part which is not necessary but makes our lives better.

		 	 <h3>  Jewelry <i class="far fa-gem"></i>  </h3> 
		     <p>  Finally my third passion is precious stones and jewelry. This ties into luxury but I strongly believe that jewelry in particular, has the ability to highlight personality and bring out the best features when wearing the right jewelry for the right occasion. After various internships in luxury Maisons,  I fell in love with the craftmanship, the purpose and the ingenuity of each time piece and how they made people feel.
